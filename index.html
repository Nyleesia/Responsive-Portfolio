        <p> My first name rhymes with Malaysia, but it starts with an "N". I have loved it ever since I 
            could pronounce it. I enjoy being open to the viewpoints of others and I appreciate the online 
            world because it is  dependent on the collaboration of numerous, unique individuals. </p> 
            <br>
            
        <p> I live in Atlanta, Georgia, but, I was born and raised Trinidad and Tobago. I love 
            the sun. I enjoy working on new projects. I thoroughly enjoy learning and I am always 
            willing to give myself the chance to step out of my comfort-zone. In fact, I have stretched 
            it so far, I don't even think that I have a comfort-zone anymore.</p> 
            <br>

        <p> My main goal is to leave the world at least a little bit better than it was 
            when I entered it! My current aim is to use my previous education in the 
            Modern and Life Sciences, Psychology and Businesss Management to improve both user experience 
            (UX), and user understanding of the vital roles that the internet plays in our daily lives. 
            I intend to learn as much as I can to contribute positively to the accessability of shared 
            knowledge available via the Web. </p>
