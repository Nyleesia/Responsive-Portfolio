# Responsive-Portfolio
Hello again :)

This repository contains a basic, but mobile responsive portfolio which I built to specifications at the end of my third week learning web development at the Georgia Tech full stack web development bootcamp.

The pace has really picked up now. In fact this is only the first of two required assignments to be submitted today. 
I am happy to be learning so very quickly though. I will try my hardest to make myself proud by the end of this program.
